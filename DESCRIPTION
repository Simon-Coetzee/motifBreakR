Description: We introduce motifbreakR, which allows the biologist to judge in
    the first place whether the sequence surrounding the polymorphism is a good
    match, and in the second place how much information is gained or lost in one
    allele of the polymorphism relative to another. MotifbreakR is both flexible
    and extensible over previous offerings; giving a choice of algorithms for
    interrogation of genomes with motifs from public sources that users can
    choose from; these are 1) a weighted-sum probability matrix,
    2) log-probabilities, and 3) weighted by relative entropy. MotifbreakR can
    predict effects for novel or previously described variants in public
    databases, making it suitable for tasks beyond the scope of its original
    design. Lastly, it can be used to interrogate any genome curated within
    bioconductor (currently there are 22).
